    <h2>Pagination</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Led the gallery pagination project that converted the Retailer Offer galleries and the all-retailers page from infinite-scroll to a paginated experience.
      Pagination is entirely front-end due to time and resource constraints.
      The Pagination object that controls all of the logic (to separate logic from unrelated display code) can take any collection we give it, no matter the data type.
      It takes an an asynchronously-loaded list of items and paginates with distinct categories.
      Allows instant re-pagination and rendering when changing category filters or moving between pages.
      Remembers selected filters and page history via custom state management.
