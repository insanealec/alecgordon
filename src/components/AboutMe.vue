  <h2>Hi, I’m Alec Gordon.</h2>

  <p class="paragraph">
    I’m a senior full-stack software engineer with 11+ years of experience building and maintaining production web
    applications. I’ve spent most of my career working on B2B and consumer-facing platforms where reliability,
    performance, and developer experience actually matter.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    I’m strongest in Vue and Laravel, and I enjoy working across the stack — especially designing APIs, improving
    data-heavy workflows, and cleaning up systems that have grown messy over time. I tend to gravitate toward work
    that reduces manual effort, improves clarity, and makes the next feature easier to build than the last.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    In senior roles, my impact has come less from process and more from output: shipping solid solutions, spotting
    weak points early, and helping teams move faster by simplifying complex problems. I’ve worked closely with
    product and non-technical stakeholders, but I’m happiest when I’m deep in the code and solving real problems.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Right now, I’m looking for a remote role where I can continue building high-quality software with a thoughtful,
    pragmatic team.
